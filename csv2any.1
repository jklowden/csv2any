.Nm csv2any

.Op Ar files ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
parses a comma-separated file (per RFC 4180) and produces the same
data with different separators on standard output.  Double-quotes
(when used as quotation) are removed from the output; quoted
characters (data) are preserved.
.Pp
The utility is a demonstration of
.Xr libanycsv 3 ,
included in the distribution. The available options are:
.Bl -tag -width 5n
.It Fl a
Use ASCII delimiters US and RS for
.Ar colsep
and
.Ar rowsep ,
respectively. 
.It Fl r Ar rowsep
Replace newline separators with
.Ar rowsep .
On input, the newline character (\c
.Ql \(rsn ,
0x0A) may optionally be preceded by a carriage-return character (\c
.Ql \(rsr ,
0x0D).
.It Fl t Ar colsep
Replace comma separators with
.Ar colsep .
.It Fl w
Warn if quoted data in the input match either colsep or rowsep.
.El
.Pp
.Ar rowsep
and
.Ar colsep
are arbitrary strings, not just single characters.
A few special
escape-sequences are supported for non-printing characters:
.Bl -tag -width 5n -offset 7n -compact
.It \(rs\(rs
backslash
.It \(rsa
audible BEL
.It \(rsb
backspace
.It \(rsf
form feed
.It \(rsn
new line
.It \(rsr
return
.It \(rst
horizontal tab
.It \(rsv
vertical tab
.El
These sequences are borrowed from those supported by the GNU
version of
.Xr tr 1 .
.
.Pp
In addition, there are two debugging options:
.Bl -tag -width 5n
.It Fl l
Produce lexer progress messages on standard error
.It Fl y
Produce yacc progress messages on standard error
.El
.
.Pp
In the absence of options, the input is recapitulated with two
changes: all quoting is removed, and lines are terminated with a
single newline (Ox0A) character.
.
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" .Sh FILES
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits with 0 status unless the input could not be parsed or memory is
exhausted.
.\" .Sh EXAMPLES
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Unless memory is exhausted, error messages from the parser are
probably bugs, because almost any file can be treated as
comma-delimited. Memory exhaustion
.Dq "should not"
happen, because the only memory used is for the data on each line, a
line at a time.
